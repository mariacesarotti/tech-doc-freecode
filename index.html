        <header>Basic Color Theory</header>
        <p>Color theory encompasses a multitude of definitions, concepts, and design applications - enough to fill several encyclopedias.</p>
        <p>However, there are three basic categories of color theory that are logical and useful:
          <ul>
            <li><a href="#the_color_wheel">the color wheel</a>;</li>
            <li><a href="#color_harmony">color harmony</a>;</li>
            <li><a href="#color_context">color context</a>;</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>Color theories create a <code>logical structure for color</code>. For example, if we have an assortment of fruits and vegetables, we can organize them by color and place them on a circle that shows the colors in relation to each other.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="the_color_wheel">
        <header>The Color Wheel</header>
        <p>A color circle, based on red, yellow, and blue, is traditional in the field of art. Sir Isaac Newton developed the first circular diagram of colors in 1666.</p>
        <p>Since then, scientists and artists have studied and designed numerous variations of this concept. Differences of opinion about the validity of one format over another continue to provoke debate. In reality, any color circle or color wheel which presents a logically arranged sequence of pure hues has merit.</p>
        <img id="color_wheels_img" src="https://www.colormatters.com/images/images3/theory-wheel-history.jpg" alt="Color Wheel History">
        <p>There are also definitions (or categories) of colors based on the color wheel. We begin with a 3-part color wheel.</p>
        <img id="3_part_color_wheels_img" src="https://www.colormatters.com/images/images3/theory-wheels-3-6-12.gif" alt="3-part Color Wheel">
        <p>
          <ul>
            <li><code>Primary Colors:</code> Red, yellow, and blue. In traditional color theory (used in paint and pigments), primary colors are the 3 pigment colors that cannot be mixed or formed by any combination of other colors. All other colors are derived from these 3 hues.</li>
            <li><code>Secondary Colors:</code> Green, orange, and purple. These are the colors formed by mixing the primary colors.</li>
            <li><code>Tertiary Colors:</code> Yellow-orange, red-orange, red-purple, blue-purple, blue-green, and yellow-green. These are the colors formed by mixing a primary and a secondary color. That's why the hue is a two-word name, such as blue-green, red-violet, and yellow-orange.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="color_harmony">
        <header>Color Harmony</header>
        <p>Harmony can be defined as a pleasing arrangement of parts, whether it be music, poetry, color, or even an ice cream sundae.</p>
        <p>In visual experiences, harmony is something that is pleasing to the eye. It engages the viewer and it creates an inner sense of order, a balance in the visual experience. When something is not harmonious, it's either boring or chaotic. At one extreme is a visual experience that is so bland that the viewer is not engaged. The human brain will reject under-stimulating information. At the other extreme is a visual experience that is so overdone, so chaotic that the viewer can't stand to look at it. The human brain rejects what it cannot organize, what it cannot understand. The visual task requires that we present a logical structure. Color harmony delivers visual interest and a sense of order.</p>
        <p>In summary, extreme unity leads to under-stimulation, extreme complexity leads to over-stimulation. Harmony is a dynamic equilibrium.</p>

      <section class="main-section" id="formulas">
        <header>Formulas</header>
        <p>There are many theories for harmony. The following illustrations and descriptions present some basic formulas.</p>
        <p>
          <ol>
            <li>A color scheme based on analogous colors:</li>
            <img class="color_scheme_img" src="https://www.colormatters.com/images/images1/ctheory_leaf.gif" alt="Analogous Colors">
            <p>Analogous colors are any three colors which are side by side on a 12-part color wheel, such as yellow-green, yellow, and yellow-orange. Usually, one of the three colors predominates.</p>
            <li>A color scheme based on complementary colors:</li>
            <img class="color_scheme_img" src="https://www.colormatters.com/images/images1/ctheory_orchid.gif" alt="Complementary Colors">
            <p>Complementary colors are any two colors which are directly opposite each other, such as red and green and red-purple and yellow-green. In the illustration above, there are several variations of yellow-green in the leaves and several variations of red-purple in the orchid. These opposing colors create maximum contrast and maximum stability.</p>
            <li>A color scheme based on nature:</li>
            <img class="color_scheme_img" src="https://www.colormatters.com/images/images1/cteory_nature.gif" alt="Nature Colors">
            <p>Nature provides a perfect departure point for color harmony. In the illustration above, red, yellow, and green create a harmonious design, regardless of whether this combination fits into a technical formula for color harmony.</p>
          </ol>
        </p>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="color_context">
        <header>Color Context</header>
        <p>How color behaves in relation to other colors and shapes is a complex area of color theory. Compare the contrast effects of different color backgrounds for the same red square.</p>
        <img src="https://www.colormatters.com/images/images1/ct-4redsq.gif" alt="Color Context Comparison">
        <p>Red appears more brilliant against a black background and somewhat duller against the white background. In contrast with orange, the red appears lifeless; in contrast with blue-green, it exhibits brilliance. Notice that the red square appears larger on black than on other background colors.</p>
        <h4>Different readings of the same color</h4>
        <img src="https://www.colormatters.com/images/images1/ct-3-4.gif" alt="Color Perception Comparison">
        <p>If your computer has sufficient <code>color stability and <a href="#gamma">gamma</a> correction</code>, you will see that the small purple rectangle on the left appears to have a red-purple tinge when compared to the small purple rectangle on the right. They are both the same color as seen in the illustration below. This demonstrates how three colors can be perceived as four colors.</p>
        <img src="https://www.colormatters.com/images/images1/ct-3-4-proof.gif" alt="Color Perception Proof">
        <p>Observing the effects colors have on each other is the starting point for understanding the relativity of color. The relationship of values, saturations, and the warmth or coolness of respective hues can cause noticeable differences in our perception of color.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="gamma">
        <header>Gamma</header>
        <p>Gamma is one of the most difficult computer terms to define. Even experienced computer technicians have a difficult time understanding what it is. We will attempt to simplify it.</p>
        <p>
          <ol>
            <li><code>Gamma is a measurement</code> - like gigabytes or calories.</li>
            <li><code>Gamma is also a mathematical formula.</code> It reflects a relationship between input and output.</li>
            <li><code>Gamma describes a critical relationship between electricity and what happens on your monitor.</code></li>
            <li><code> Finally, gamma is a mathematical formula that describes the relationship between the voltage input and the brightness of the image on your monitor screen.</code></li>
            <li>Or, think of it this way: when expressing a color in RGB (red, green, blue), what we are specifying is the amount of light which will be emitted from each phosphor, as a fraction of full power. What we are actually specifying is, however, the voltage which will be applied to each electron gun.</li>
            <li>Gamma can also be described as the measurement of contrast that affects the midtones of an image.</li>
            <li>A gamma measurement can apply to several elements within your computer system:</li>
              <ul>
                <li>the cathode ray tube (CRT) in your monitor. See Computer Color Tips for information about CRT's and input voltage</li>
                <li>the hardware look-up table (LUT)</li>
                <li>the overall output</li>
              </ul>
            <li>Generally, gamma measurements will range from 1.0 to 3.0. Different systems will have different gamma measurements. An effective gamma rating will deliver true colors and a good range of light, middle, and dark tones. Some computers come equipped with sufficient gamma correction. For example, the Macintosh operating system contains a built-in graphic card that automatically corrects the gamma. Other systems may require more gamma correction to achieve effective viewing conditions for images. Some PCs and Unix may require correction.</li>
